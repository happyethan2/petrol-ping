# PetrolNotification
Python project that is hosted on PythonAnywhere as a daily task to notify users when fuel prices are at cyclic lows. The program leverages emerging AI tech through
the OpenAI API to condense a buying tip from the ACCC. The price is calculated as the 5th percentile value for all prices in Adelaide for any specific fuel type. The notification is sent through the Pushover API to users who provide a user key.
